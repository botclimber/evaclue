# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

What was done to create this:
-npm init vite (project name)
-npm install
-npm run dev

// an overview of what i understood about vue dev:
(data, methods, computed, props, components, ...)
- data deals with data and return it to be used in the html
- methods are the logic and controllers
- computed is something that im not sure yet
- props are values from parent components
- components are other pages with diff logic
